# odin-signup-form

This project is an assignment from Odin's Project to apply what we learnt from the past previous lessons. In this project, I am to work on forms, logos, custom-fonts, layouts and mimicking designed landing page. 

Reflections:

1. Eventhough it is somewhat responsive, it still irritates me everytime some parts are not responsive, once I zoomed in and zoomed out.

2. I'm enjoying the part on how to contain images and insert logos into my website. It's starting to look cool.

3. The Norsebold font doesn't seem to work at all, but I learnt that sometimes that will be the case, and we have to emphasize on the importance of fall-backs and alternatives. 

4. In conclusion, I learned how to be a bit more creative with html & css in this project.
